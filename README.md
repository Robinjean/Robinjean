Hi, I am Jean Robin, passionate mathematician with a Bachelor's in Pure Mathematics from the University of Antananarivo and a Master's from AIMS Ghana. Experienced in applying mathematical models to real-world challenges during a 6-month internship at ACMAD, Niamey, Niger. Currently pursuing AMMI in Senegal, merging my love for mathematics with cutting-edge machine learning and AI. Eager to contribute to a Ph.D. program, focused on the intersection of applied and pure mathematics or machine learning and artificial intelligence. #Mathematics #MachineLearning #AI #PassionateScientist
